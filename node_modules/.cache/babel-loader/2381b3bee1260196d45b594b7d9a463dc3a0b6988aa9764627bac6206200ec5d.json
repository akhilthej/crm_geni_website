Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</a><br/>\nCalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.\nAccording to CalOPPA we agree to the following:\n0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;\n0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;\n0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;\n0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at admin@cyberspacedigital.in.\nOur Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:\nWe honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place.

Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a><br/>\nIf you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it.

If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of the information.

We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.\nIf you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.\nPlease note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.\nTo exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email: admin@cyberspacedigital.in.\nYour data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA, short for the California Consumer Privacy Act.

We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.\nWe have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.\nFor example, the outlined privacy policy has been made using PolicyMaker.io, a free tool that helps create high-quality legal documents. PolicyMaker’s privacy policy generator is an easy-to-use tool for creating a privacy policy for blog, website, e-commerce store or mobile app.\n<br/><br/><a className='text-2xl font-medium text-black'>19.

If you become aware that a Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from Children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.\n<br/><br/><a className='text-2xl font-medium text-black'>20.
